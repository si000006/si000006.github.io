    <article><h2>Abouot me</h2></article>
<p>Greetings,yall. Shengyang here, just call me <strong>Yang</strong>, easier for you to say and me to understand. Chinese mainlander with a huge interest in almost every aspect of this program except for programming. Sorry, Rob, not so sorry. Always had the description of <q>youtuber wanna be</q> in my discord bio, that kind of sums my past few years up. </p>    
<p>Started a youtube channel back in 2020, did not do well. Tried doing <abbr title="Gundam Plastic Model">Gunpla</abbr> painting video ended up only getting paid by actual painting commissions. Though that did put food on the table and I did not have to work a 9<sup>am</sup> to 5<sup>pm</sup> job so I guess it worked out. Also did <abbr title="Streaming using a virtual avatar">vtubing</abbr> full time for 7 months cause I was tired of painting the same model 70 times in a row. That gig works well in the beginning then died. And for a tons of reasons I can not possibly fit in here, I decided take a shot at immigration to Canada. </p>

    <h3>OC/sona building</h3>
    <p><strong>OC</strong> stands for original characters. And Sona means an artistic representation of yourself. Which is what the above image is, however, I got more than one Sona. Building them is writing stories, building a world they live in. Make your own magical land or a sci-fi future can be really fun. Sometimes commissioning artists to draw illustrations for them. This part is the main way I spend my hobby money. </p>
    <h3>Plamo Painting</h3>
    <p>Plamo means plasic models. I am interested mainly in sci fi models like giant robots or futuristic vehicle. Very intrigued by how painting can change the look and feel of a model. Not just by changing colors, but also adding volume, lighting, different textures to it. It's kind of like drawing, but on a three dimensional shape.</p>
