<p>Greetings,yall. Shengyang here, just call me <strong>Yang</strong>, easier for you to say and me to understand. Chinese mainlander with a huge interest in almost every aspect of this program except for programming. Sorry, Rob, not so sorry. Always had the description of <q>youtuber wanna be</q> in my discord bio, that kind of sums my past few years up. </p>    
<p>Started a youtube channel back in 2020, did not do well. Tried doing <abbr title="Gundam Plastic Model">Gunpla</abbr> painting video ended up only getting paid by actual painting commissions. Though that did put food on the table and I did not have to work a 9<sup>am</sup> to 5<sup>pm</sup> job so I guess it worked out. Also did <abbr title="Streaming using a virtual avatar">vtubing</abbr> full time for 7 months cause I was tired of painting the same model 70 times in a row. That gig works well in the beginning then died. And for a tons of reasons I can not possibly fit in here, I decided take a shot at immigration to Canada. </p>
